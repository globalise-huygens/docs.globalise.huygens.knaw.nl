The [GLOBALISE project](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/) aims to develop an online infrastructure to unlock key VOC documents and reports for advanced research. This Docs page provides background on the project, including sections on our [Mission and scope](mission/mission_researchthemes.md), and [Ethics policy](ethics/policy.md). We also present a selection of [materials that were once available on the TANAP website](tanap/), including an overview of archival inventories of VOC-related collections worldwide and a large collection of transcriptions of documents of the Orphan Chamber and Council of Policy of the VOC settlement at the Cape of Good Hope.

Future additions will include documentation of the GLOBALISE ontology, a description of source corpus, and guiding principles for interface design. We welcome your feedback through our [contact form](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/contact-us/).
