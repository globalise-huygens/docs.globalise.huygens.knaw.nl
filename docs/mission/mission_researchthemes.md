## Introduction: Our Position and Contributions

The extensive and detailed archives of the Dutch East India Company (the Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie, or VOC) are invaluable for studying not only the VOC world itself but also the often under-documented societies of early modern Africa, Asia, and Australia. They shed light on the many local, regional, and global interactions between these regions (e.g., [Kuruppath 2019](https://doi.org/10.18352/bmgn-lchr.10688)). Funded to create a research infrastructure for these archives, the GLOBALISE project focuses on the *Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren* (OBP), which contains copies of reports, letters, and other documents from regions where the VOC was active. We make the OBP’s contents available by identifying entities and events in a full transcription of the archival text, further contextualised with high-quality reference data and documentation. This information is freely accessible in a user-friendly, advanced research environment. With these activities, the GLOBALISE project aims to foster new, diverse, and more representative histories based on VOC archives.

The project is conceived as both an infrastructural and archival contribution, with expected impacts on digital humanities and historiography.

1. **Moving Beyond Searchability to Researchability**  
   First, we aim to move the focus of infrastructures for digised archives beyond searchability (e.g., keyword search of transcribed text) to focus on advancing researchability. We achieve this by combining natural language processing and digital humanities technologies with ‘historical contextualisation’. Here, we create high-quality, curated, and validated historical knowledge that is incorporated into domain-specific reference data and thesauri (for example, for polities, persons, commodities, and ships). This combination ensures that automatic methods for recognising and identifying events and entities in the digitised archival material produce observations relevant to historical research. Our aim is not merely to enable researchers and the broader public to perform free text searches on a vast, rich archival corpus; instead, we go beyond free-text searches to provide contextualisation, enabling new ways of conducting historical research.

2. **Innovative, Inclusive Techniques**  
   Our mission lies in finding responsible and useful methods to combine historical and semantic contextualisation while simultaneously encouraging the ‘democratisation’ of research, data, and knowledge. We strive to keep technical barriers low for potential users, making our infrastructure accessible to academic and societal audiences worldwide. The acronym of our project, derived from its technical approach (the **G**eneral **L**etters **O**ntology-**B**ased **A**ccessibility **I**nfra**S**tructur**E**[^1]), also emphasises that globalisation has historically been unequal. The forces of colonialism and capitalism continuously produced connectedness alongside dispossession and exploitation. This applies to both ‘early globalisation’ which accelerated with European colonial expansion, and ‘high globalisation’, which began in the 1980s and continues in the digital era. The project name reminds us of these historical and contemporary inequalities, and we seek to move away from the exploitative aspects of globalisation by building and publishing our work in an open, reusable, and inclusive way. To this end, we actively reach out to scholars worldwide to incorporate multiple perspectives and scrutinise colonial biases that led to uneven knowledge production and its availability in digital form.

3. **Historiographic Intervention**  
   The longstanding disregard of the VOC’s colonial, expansionist, and violent character has led to a limited, persistently Eurocentric perspective in VOC historiography. While area studies, non-Western, and world history have used VOC archives to explore histories of local societies, polities, people, and their resilience, the dominant narrative still portrays the VOC as a ‘merchant’ focused on trade and shipping. This ignores the broader historical reality: the VOC’s colonial empire-building, its organisation of international political order (war and diplomacy), its administration of territorial possessions (rule and governance), and its regulation of commodity production (agriculture, mining, etc.). This revised perspective reframes the VOC as a colonial force acting as ‘military’, ‘government’, and ‘producer’. It also raises questions about the VOC’s impact on local people and societies and how these interactions shaped local, regional, and global histories ([Van Rossum 2019](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020859019000014)).

This historiographic shift emphasises using VOC archives to study (a) local, global, and colonial political, economic, cultural, social, and everyday interactions in the early modern world and (b) the transformations many societies experienced as a result of these interactions. These questions on European colonial expansion and globalisation’s effects on local societies are crucial to academic and societal debates on the legacies of colonialism, capitalism, slavery, and racialisation. By utilising the VOC archives, the project aims to ‘unseat’ the VOC as the principal object of study, instead highlighting the politics and societies in the Indian Ocean World as historical subjects in their own right. To support this objective, the project is actively developing, collecting, and curating more data on non-European entities, such as persons, polities, commodities, ships, and communities.

## Research Themes Guiding the Infrastructure

Rigorous historical and technical work is required to handle the abundance and heterogeneity of primary source material in the archives. Central to this effort is understanding the historical contexts and relationships between entities. This contextualisation requires a focused, domain-specific approach, but it is clear that GLOBALISE should not be limited to a single thematic research area. Instead, it should cover a well-considered selection of domains to serve a wide range of audiences and research interests.

Shaping our vision based on the three interventions described above, we have formulated the following guiding questions:

- Why and how did interactions between (European) colonial actors and (non-European) local societies develop according to specific historical patterns?
- How did expanding European influence impact political, societal, economic, environmental, and cultural developments in the wider Indian Ocean, Indonesian Archipelago, and East Asian Seas regions?
- How can the VOC archives be used to their fullest potential in writing histories of local, non-Western societies?

To answer these questions, we have identified a series of themes and sub-themes that can stimulate a wide range of research into the social, political, economic, and cultural history of European expansion, non-Western societies, early globalisation, and related interactions. The key thematic domains we have defined are:

- Political
- Economic
- Social
- Cultural
- Environmental
- Other

These themes will guide the development of a research infrastructure allowing extraction of useful historical observations from the *Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren*. While we recognise that any selection is inherently subjective, we have based our choices on several factors: the content of the source material (what appears most frequently), the relevance of themes for the widest range of research interests (which domains and information are most essential for diverse questions and research types), and the potential for contributing new perspectives and histories (especially for studying local and non-Western societies, globalisation, and histories of colonisation and encounter).

Given the prominent place of political and economic history, it may appear that our work prioritises themes that have traditionally dominated historiography over the last two centuries. However, it is important to note that our focus on seemingly conventional themes is paired with deliberately unconventional efforts: (i) in the case of political history, we aim to highlight lesser-known Asian polities that have received minimal attention in traditional historiography; and (ii) we seek to mitigate the prevailing emphasis on Dutch trade and shipping by also examining the more invasive aspects of European colonialism, as well as the economic, political, and social activities of non-European actors.

### From Themes to Research Practice

The GLOBALISE infrastructure enables both simple and sophisticated text searches on the resource corpus. Our temporary, basic, [transcription viewer](https://transcriptions.globalise.huygens.knaw.nl) already allows for this. In our future user interface, researchers will be able to query combinations of entities and events that yield results with contextual information. Notably, while these queries are descriptive (what, where, and when), researchers must further analyse and interpret results to answer explanatory research questions (how and why).

Key infrastructure components that allow querying on entities and events, and provide contextualised results, include:

1. **Structured Historical Reference Data**  
   Reference data provides basic information about entities, such as early modern polities, rulers, locations, and persons, and also information about non-European weights, measures, currencies, calendars, and conversions between them.

2. **Thesauri and Vocabularies**  
   Thesauri and vocabularies provide definitions for many European and non-European concepts in the VOC archives, such as commodities, occupations, ethnicities, religious groups, and location types.

3. **Annotations**  
   Annotations link mentions of entities, concepts, and events in the archival materials to the reference data.

3. **Ontology**  
   The ontology structures relations between entities, concepts, and events.

The labour-intensive development of these components, especially high-quality reference data and ontologies, requires strategic choices about the scope and coverage of themes and contextualisation efforts. A set of [guiding key research queries](#research-questions-and-infrastructure-elements) for each of the thematic domains help direct this work, ensuring we provide the necessary elements to support a wide range of research questions.

### Responsible Design and Use of the GLOBALISE infrastructure

The questions outlined in this document guide the development of the infrastructure and are based on our knowledge of the source structure and content, as well as our understanding of how entity annotation, event annotation, and historical contextualisation can facilitate complex, historicised querying.

#### Accessibility and Project Accountability

We recognise the immense value of creating an infrastructure that allows users to ask precise questions of the archive. However, we are mindful of the challenges this endeavour brings. While the infrastructure can make the archive more accessible, it also influences what is searched and found, which histories are written, and which topics enter public debate. This concern is critical given the archive’s colonial
bias. To ensure we remain accountable, we document all our work responsibly and strive to communicate the limitations and implications of our infrastructure clearly to users. Interim publications of curated data, published on [our Dataverse](https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/dataverse/globalise), include rich documentation, and the final infrastructure will feature reflective documentation.

Similarly, a critical perspective is required when using the project’s curated historical data. This data is shaped by the worldviews, knowledge, and expertise of the project team and contributors. We strive for transparency about our positionality, adhering to up-to-date ethical standards. However, we acknowledge that neutrality is unattainable. Large-scale digitisation and enrichment efforts carry inherent pitfalls, and given the size of the archives, we must rely on machine learning for event and entity annotations, which we can only partially manually check for accuracy. Transparency about methods, findings, and efforts to ensure consistency, historical accuracy, and limit gaps and biases remains our priority.

This discussion of the potential drawbacks or shortcomings of our infrastructure is not intended as an excuse, but rather as a reminder and call to action: to engage with the archive responsibly, to design our infrastructure in an open and reflective manner, to check and improve the quality of its content, and to instruct, educate, and challenge users to fully explore its potential (while remaning aware of the limitations), and continuing to develop our source and methodological criticism.

#### Harnessing Big Data Responsibly

As researchers engage with the new possibilities of digital archives, we emphasise the need for critical methods when interpreting digital sources. Researchers should reflect on each document’s type, context, authorship, and purpose. The archives do not provide unfiltered historical truths; they offer fragmented observations and interpretations that require careful contextualisation. Advanced search functions enable researchers to extract snippets of information, but these should be understood as representations of historical realities shaped by the document’s context.

While the infrastructure project remains transparent about the processes, tools, and methods used, we cannot anticipate all forms of future usage. We call on users to engage responsibly and contextually, and we will work to provide guidance on how to do so.

## Research Questions and Infrastructure Elements

What questions can be asked of the archive? What queries can be facilitated by more advanced forms of querying and research? In the second part of this document, we explain and illustrate the guiding research questions that our infrastructure supports. These guiding research questions are formulated as generalised queries. For instance, a researcher might ask, ‘Which polities were in conflict with the VOC between 1640 and 1690?’, or ‘At which moments was Banten conquered by other polities?’ These are all manifestations of our guiding key research question: ‘When and which polities (or rulers) were in conflict with other polities?’ These questions inform our infrastructure’s components, such as datasets, thesauri, and the event ontology.

For a user to find relevant information about these questions, the GLOBALISE infrastructure needs to provide the following elements:

1.	**Reference data**
Our dataset on early modern polities provides users with chronological information on polities like Banten, including locations, rulers, and periods of rule. If Sultan Agon appears in the archive, users will find contextual information identifying him as Banten’s ruler from 1651 to 1683. We also compile all name and spelling variations (e.g., Banten as Bantam, Banttam, Bantamm), making it easier for users to locate these entities, regardless of spelling differences in their queries.

2.	**Thesaurus**
For the research questions mentioned here, we classify polities and rulerships into categories allowing users to expand or narrow their searches. 

3.	**Annotations and Ontology**
We tag all mentions of polities in the archive and our event detection process identifies events that involve actions such as attacking (which includes sub-classes such as starting a war, ending a war, besieging and invasion), destroying and relationship-change. This enables us to plot all such events that are suggestive of troubled interactions which involve actors such as the polities Banten and the VOC, together with other relevant information such as when and where these events occurred. Users will therefore be able to sift through the archive and search for precisely those passages which signal conflict or conquest. 

In the following overview of our guiding key research questions we will for each question indicate how these are related to different domains of our historical reference data for entities (and conversions and events), as well as for different sections of the thesauri and event ontology. These guiding questions shape our efforts to design an infrastructure that facilitates targeted historical research, ensuring that the VOC archives are accessible for exploring specific themes and inquiries.

Researchers can use this overview to gain a clearer understanding of the types of research the GLOBALISE infrastructure is built to support. Each question aligns with one of the project’s five core domains—Political, Economic, Social, Environmental, and Cultural—that we identified as essential for studying the VOC’s historical impact. For each domain, we provide a list of ‘research ingredients’—specific data types, document categories, and resources within the infrastructure—that aid in locating relevant information.

The accompanying diagram provides an overview of this structure. The five research domains are represented in colored ellipses, each associated with guiding questions. Surrounding these domains are various components of the GLOBALISE infrastructure, displayed in white boxes. Colored diamonds indicate which components are relevant to each domain, illustrating how the infrastructure links diverse data elements to address a broad range of historical research needs.

## Current Status

Our goal is to deliver high-quality relevant data for the five prioritised domains. Datasets have been created or are in the making for polities (and rulers and dynasties), commodities, units of measurement, locations  and persons. We publish datasets as soon as first versions are ready for the public on [our Dataverse](https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/dataverse/globalise). The social domain will be next on our list, after which we will explore what we can do to work on the environmental and cultural domains. The thesaurus for different domains is currently work in progress with colleagues from all over the globe. The entity recognition and event detection models are in full development, with the quality the first output of the entity recognition for a wide variety of classes now being evaluated.

Please note that this document is not a final statement but a plan for developing themes, reference data, and queries over time based on project demands, infrastructure, and user interaction. We welcome any input, advice, and questions to improve our work.

[^1]: The ‘General Letters’ are summarising reports within the *Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren* (OBP) archival document series. Early in the project, we have widened the scope to include the full OBP series. We think this better fit the aims of the project, as also described in this statement.
