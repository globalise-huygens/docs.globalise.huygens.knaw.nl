# Guiding Key Research Questions

## Introduction

This page presents the key research questions that steer the GLOBALISE project in its mission to unlock the *Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren* (OBP) series of VOC documents. These guiding questions shape our efforts to design an infrastructure that facilitates targeted historical research, ensuring that the VOC archives are accessible for exploring specific themes and inquiries.

Researchers can use this page to gain a clearer understanding of the types of research the GLOBALISE infrastructure is built to support. Each question aligns with one of the project’s five core domains—Political, Economic, Social, Environmental, and Cultural—that we identified as essential for studying the VOC’s historical impact (see [GLOBALISE project’s Mission and Scope](/mission/mission_researchthemes)). For each domain, we provide a list of ‘research ingredients’—specific data types, document categories, and resources within the infrastructure—that aid in locating relevant information.

The accompanying diagram provides an overview of this structure. The five research domains are represented in colored ellipses, each associated with guiding questions. Surrounding these domains are various components of the GLOBALISE infrastructure, displayed in white boxes. Colored diamonds indicate which components are relevant to each domain, illustrating how the infrastructure links diverse data elements to address a broad range of historical research needs.
