Mission Statement","text":"<p>GLOBALISE is an infrastructure project dedicated to enhancing the way we access and understand the archives of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). This infrastructural endeavour aims to unveil interactions between European stakeholders and, more crucially, non-European entities, operating within and around the VOC\u2019s \u2018empire\u2019. By doing so, GLOBALISE will shed new light on the mechanisms of early globalisation, colonialisation, and their formative and enduring impact on regions stretching from Europe, especially the Netherlands, to the vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and Indonesian Archipelago.</p> <p>Our mission can be encapsulated in the following core commitments:</p> <p>1. Enhancing Accessibility At its core, GLOBALISE is committed to making a substantial segment of the VOC archives not just accessible, but contextually relevant to audiences worldwide. Through this project, history enthusiasts, researchers, and the global community will gain an unprecedented level of insight into the VOC\u2019s expansive influence and interactions. This objective will be achieved by transforming the archives into digitised and searchable text using handwritten text recognition. Additionally, GLOBALISE will employ historic and semantic contextualisation to enhance research possibilities and allow for richer representations of history. And finally it will develop versatile interfaces, designed to cater to a diverse range of users. </p> <p>2. Linked Open Data We will model, publish, and host our data as Linked Open Data (LOD), link them to external datasets and thesauri, and thus facilitate easy re-use of our data, aligning with the FAIR principles and global LOD initiatives in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector.</p> <p>3. Tools GLOBALISE will offer a comprehensive suite of open source tools, allowing users to engage with, analyse, and reinterpret historical archives. These tools are designed to support a range of activities, from data creation, annotation, documentation, filtering and visualisation.</p> <p>4. Addressing Power Imbalances and Biases We acknowledge power imbalances and historical injustices recorded in and accompanying the creation of the VOC archives and actively work towards amplifying marginalised perspectives, supplementing the VOC archives with non-European perspectives to challenge dominant narratives and foster a more comprehensive understanding of (colonial) history. </p> <p>5. Transparency We believe in being transparent about the origins and frameworks behind data. We are committed to disclosing our methodologies, acknowledging the limitations of our data, and inviting community feedback to ensure our work is grounded in ethical and responsible practices.</p> <p>6. Free and Open Access Adhering to the FAIR principles, all our resources, software, and data are licensed under open and permissive licences. </p> <p>7. Diversity, Inclusion, Equity, and Decolonisation This commitment extends across all aspects of the project, from the selection of datasets to resource allocation, community engagement, and team composition. </p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#iii-ethics-guidelines","title":"III. Ethics Guidelines","text":"<p>The GLOBALISE initiative places ethical adherence at the forefront throughout its lifecycle, including work packages, future plans, and governance frameworks. Regular evaluations will identify any aspect of the project falling short of these standards, prompting necessary restructuring to align with our ethics guidelines.</p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#1-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei","title":"1. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)","text":"<p>GLOBALISE is dedicated to advancing DEI in every part of the project: people, governance, perspectives, datasets, algorithms, and interfaces. We define DEI as follows:</p> <p>Diversity encompasses a wide range of differences and variations within any given environment or system. Diversity may include variations in not  only individual characteristics like ethnicity, age, gender identity, religion, physical abilities and disabilities, cultural background, and education but also extends to encompass differences in ideas, perspectives, datasets, algorithms, infrastructural elements, and any other factors that contribute to the overall complexity and richness of the system in question. Embracing diversity means recognizing, appreciating, and harnessing the breadth and depth of distinctions.</p> <p>Equity strives to rectify disparities and create a level playing field for all elements within a system. </p> <p>Inclusion refers to the behaviours, attitudes, and social norms within our project that ensures that there is space for multiple identities, groups and expressions.</p> <p>The way in which we advance DEI is visible in the following points:</p> <p>Countering Bias We pay attention to situations involving vulnerable groups and those that have been historically disadvantaged or at a risk of exclusion and to situations characterised by asymmetries of power.</p> <p>Education and Training We provide regular training and workshops to increase awareness and sensitivity about diversity, equity, and inclusion both in our project and in our work.</p> <p>Accessibility and Design Our infrastructure design approach acknowledges and addresses advantages and challenges faced by different social groups. </p> <p>Stakeholder Participation GLOBALISE finds it critical to work with stakeholders who may directly or indirectly be affected by the infrastructure. We do so by having a large steering team and external advisors, as well as organising regular workshops to share our work, collaborate with and get feedback from stakeholders. Furthermore, we are working on setting up longer term mechanisms for stakeholder participation.</p> <p>Documentation We include all our interventions and strategies to promote DEI in extensive documentation and reports.</p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#2-transparency","title":"2. Transparency","text":"<p>Transparency refers to open disclosure about our project\u2019s data sources, algorithms, decisions, and governance structures.</p> <p>This entails:</p> <p>Documentation of different parts of the GLOBALISE infrastructure to aid transparency and explainability. This includes data cards/sheets for datasets, model cards for NLP models, thesaurus for terminology, reports on stakeholder participation, etc. </p> <p>Communication of the characteristics, limitations, and potential shortcomings of the system to users and stakeholders, through interface design and user guides.  </p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#3-accountability","title":"3. Accountability","text":"<p>Accountability refers to the project\u2019s ownership of its decisions and outcomes, adherence to laws and policies, and its obligation to address consequences.</p> <p>This includes:</p> <p>Auditability This will include providing extensive provenance on the data produced and provided by GLOBALISE and any other authoritative layers that we add, creating meticulous datasheets for every dataset produced, and publishing datasets and research in peer-reviewed journals. </p> <p>Training and Education to help develop accountability practices. </p> <p>Redress Mechanisms Establishing systems to inform and provide recourse to users and third parties.</p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#4-societal-and-environmental-wellbeing","title":"4. Societal and Environmental Wellbeing","text":"<p>GLOBALISE should benefit society and ensure that it is sustainable and minimises environmental impact. </p> <p>Societal Wellbeing involves recognizing how the project can affect various communities.</p> <p>This entails understanding the social and cultural dimensions of the content within the archive. Archives contain materials that use language or express views that are now considered offensive or inappropriate. GLOBALISE will warn users of such content in the VOC archives and will contextualise records of contentious or violent past events with sensitivity toward affected groups.</p> <p>Ecological Impact involves consideration of the environmental footprint.</p> <p>GLOBALISE will consider the environmental footprint of the project throughout its entire lifecycle, from development to implementation. </p> <p>Data and Infrastructure Choices When building and maintaining our infrastructure, we opt for energy-efficient solutions without compromising on performance or reliability.</p> <p>Resource-Efficient Alternatives Acknowledging the diverse capabilities of our users, we will provide alternative, lighter versions of our models and datasets. This approach ensures that our resources are accessible to a broader audience, including those without access to high-end computing facilities. </p> <p>Publishing for Accessibility In publishing our data and tooling, we ensure that our deliverables are optimised for varied computational environments. We provide clear documentation and support for both our full-scale and minimal models, ensuring that users can choose the most suitable option for their specific context.</p> <p>The last 2 apply to AI systems:</p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#5-robustness","title":"5. Robustness","text":"<p>Robustness focuses on the stability and reliability of the AI systems in the GLOBALISE infrastructure. Additionally, they should be socially robust, implying they should consider potential unintended consequences and harms that may arise from their use.</p> <p>This includes addressing questions such as:</p> <p>Accuracy Ensuring system reliability in unforeseen circumstances and minimising potential harms from inaccuracies.</p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#6-privacy-and-data-governance","title":"6. Privacy and Data Governance","text":"<p>Privacy is the right of individuals to control or influence what infomration related to them may be collected and stored, and regulate who may have access to that information.</p> <p>Data Protection includes measures and practices implemented to ensure that personal data is handled in compliance with data protection laws and regulations, safeguarding the rights and freedoms of individuals.</p> <p>Data Governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data employed our project, including the policies, processes, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of the data.  </p> <p>We prioritise privacy, data protection, and data governance ensuring the quality and integrity of data and controlling data access, in the following ways:</p> <p>Ensuring Data Quality and Integrity We implement rigorous procedures to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of the data we collect, process, and make available. This includes regular audits, validation processes, and updates to reflect the most accurate historical interpretations and data representations.</p> <p>Data Storage GLOBALISE will store their data with institutes such as the IISG which have acquired the Core Trust Seal, making them a reliable and sustainable repository for digital materials. </p> <p>Privacy We prioritize informed consent and transparency in our data practices, ensuring users are aware of how their data is used. Moreover, as far as possible, GLOBALISE intends to minimise the collection of user data. When the collection of data is necessary for enhancing user experience or for research purposes, we limit the scope to non-sensitive information that does not directly identify individuals.</p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#iv-references","title":"IV.
