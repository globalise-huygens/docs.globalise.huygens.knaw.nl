This corpus allows  the creation of new global histories, including for regions where archival sources are scarce. However, the corpus predominantly reflects the VOC's perspective, a limitation that GLOBALISE recognises and strives to actively address.          In pursuit of a more balanced historical narrative, GLOBALISE is committed to developing its infrastructure in such a way that it allows for the inclusion of additional perspectives. Crucial to this expansion is the project's engagement in stakeholder participation. GLOBALISE regularly consults with a user panel and an advisory board, comprising experts and representatives from diverse backgrounds. This ongoing dialogue not only aids in refining access to the OBP but also plays an important role in identifying ways to include additional sources and perspectives that would be a valuable addition to the infrastructure.          This approach illustrates GLOBALISE's commitment to upholding the principles of DEI by ensuring that the resources offered are not only expansive but also representative of the multifaceted histories of the regions and peoples affected by the VOC's activities.          Transparency GLOBALISE openly acknowledges the limitations of its source corpus, mainly stemming from its VOC-centric perspective. This transparency is crucial in guiding researchers to understand the context and potential biases of the information presented. The project's commitment to facilitating the incorporation of additional historical perspectives  exemplifies its dedication to transparency, ensuring that users are aware of both the strengths and the limitations of the current archival content. Accountability In its handling of the VOC archives, GLOBALISE shows accountability by openly acknowledging the inherent biases in its source materials. The project tries to actively pursue the inclusion of additional perspectives to address these biases, by unsilencing the voices in the source corpus that do not speak from the VOC perspective and striving to facilitate the inclusion of other sources in the infrastructure. This approach reflects a responsible and ethical engagement with historical resources, demonstrating a commitment to rectifying historical imbalances in narrative and representation.          Well-being Offering online access to the GLOBALISE source corpus contributes to societal well being because it allows researchers and anyone interested to illuminate aspects of early modern global history, particularly about regions underrepresented in historical narratives. The project thus aids in the creation of more nuanced understandings of historical events and societal structures.          The digital nature of the project is likely to reduce the environmental footprint associated with physical archival research. Moreover, generating and making transcriptions available centrally represents efficient use of energy.          Robustness Not applicable Privacy + Data The original source corpus of the OBP is kept by the National Archives.

They shed light on the many local, regional, and global interactions between these regions (e.g., Kuruppath 2019). Funded to create a research infrastructure for these archives, the GLOBALISE project focuses on the Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren (OBP), which contains copies of reports, letters, and other documents from regions where the VOC was active. We make the OBP\u2019s contents available by identifying entities and events in a full transcription of the archival text, further contextualised with high-quality reference data and documentation. This information is freely accessible in a user-friendly, advanced research environment. With these activities, the GLOBALISE project aims to foster new, diverse, and more representative histories based on VOC archives.</p> <p>The project is conceived as both an infrastructural and archival contribution, with expected impacts on digital humanities and historiography.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Moving Beyond Searchability to Researchability    First, we aim to move the focus of infrastructures for digised archives beyond searchability (e.g., keyword search of transcribed text) to focus on advancing researchability. We achieve this by combining natural language processing and digital humanities technologies with \u2018historical contextualisation\u2019. Here, we create high-quality, curated, and validated historical knowledge that is incorporated into domain-specific reference data and thesauri (for example, for polities, persons, commodities, and ships). This combination ensures that automatic methods for recognising and identifying events and entities in the digitised archival material produce observations relevant to historical research. Our aim is not merely to enable researchers and the broader public to perform free text searches on a vast, rich archival corpus; instead, we go beyond free-text searches to provide contextualisation, enabling new ways of conducting historical research.</p> </li> <li> <p>Innovative, Inclusive Techniques    Our mission lies in finding responsible and useful methods to combine historical and semantic contextualisation while simultaneously encouraging the \u2018democratisation\u2019 of research, data, and knowledge. We strive to keep technical barriers low for potential users, making our infrastructure accessible to academic and societal audiences worldwide. The acronym of our project, derived from its technical approach (the General Letters Ontology-Based Accessibility InfraStructurE<sup>1</sup>), also emphasises that globalisation has historically been unequal. The forces of colonialism and capitalism continuously produced connectedness alongside dispossession and exploitation. This applies to both \u2018early globalisation\u2019 which accelerated with European colonial expansion, and \u2018high globalisation\u2019, which began in the 1980s and continues in the digital era. The project name reminds us of these historical and contemporary inequalities, and we seek to move away from the exploitative aspects of globalisation by building and publishing our work in an open, reusable, and inclusive way. To this end, we actively reach out to scholars worldwide to incorporate multiple perspectives and scrutinise colonial biases that led to uneven knowledge production and its availability in digital form.</p> </li> <li> <p>Historiographic Intervention    The longstanding disregard of the VOC\u2019s colonial, expansionist, and violent character has led to a limited, persistently Eurocentric perspective in VOC historiography. While area studies, non-Western, and world history have used VOC archives to explore histories of local societies, polities, people, and their resilience, the dominant narrative still portrays the VOC as a \u2018merchant\u2019 focused on trade and shipping. This ignores the broader historical reality: the VOC\u2019s colonial empire-building, its organisation of international political order (war and diplomacy), its administration of territorial possessions (rule and governance), and its regulation of commodity production (agriculture, mining, etc.). This revised perspective reframes the VOC as a colonial force acting as \u2018military\u2019, \u2018government\u2019, and \u2018producer\u2019. It also raises questions about the VOC\u2019s impact on local people and societies and how these interactions shaped local, regional, and global histories (Van Rossum 2019).</p> </li> </ol> <p>This historiographic shift emphasises using VOC archives to study (a) local, global, and colonial political, economic, cultural, social, and everyday interactions in the early modern world and (b) the transformations many societies experienced as a result of these interactions. These questions on European colonial expansion and globalisation\u2019s effects on local societies are crucial to academic and societal debates on the legacies of colonialism, capitalism, slavery, and racialisation. By utilising the VOC archives, the project aims to \u2018unseat\u2019 the VOC as the principal object of study, instead highlighting the politics and societies in the Indian Ocean World as historical subjects in their own right. To support this objective, the project is actively developing, collecting, and curating more data on non-European entities, such as persons, polities, commodities, ships, and communities.</p>"},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#research-themes-guiding-the-infrastructure","title":"Research Themes Guiding the Infrastructure","text":"<p>Rigorous historical and technical work is required to handle the abundance and heterogeneity of primary source material in the archives. Central to this effort is understanding the historical contexts and relationships between entities. This contextualisation requires a focused, domain-specific approach, but it is clear that GLOBALISE should not be limited to a single thematic research area. Instead, it should cover a well-considered selection of domains to serve a wide range of audiences and research interests.</p> <p>Shaping our vision based on the three interventions described above, we have formulated the following guiding questions:</p> <ul> <li>Why and how did interactions between (European) colonial actors and (non-European) local societies develop according to specific historical patterns?</li> <li>How did expanding European influence impact political, societal, economic, environmental, and cultural developments in the wider Indian Ocean, Indonesian Archipelago, and East Asian Seas regions?</li> <li>How can the VOC archives be used to their fullest potential in writing histories of local, non-Western societies?</li> </ul> <p>To answer these questions, we have identified a series of themes and sub-themes that can stimulate a wide range of research into the social, political, economic, and cultural history of European expansion, non-Western societies, early globalisation, and related interactions. The key thematic domains we have defined are:</p> <ul> <li>Political</li> <li>Economic</li> <li>Social</li> <li>Cultural</li> <li>Environmental</li> <li>Other</li> </ul> <p>These themes will guide the development of a research infrastructure allowing extraction of useful historical observations from the Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren. While we recognise that any selection is inherently subjective, we have based our choices on several factors: the content of the source material (what appears most frequently), the relevance of themes for the widest range of research interests (which domains and information are most essential for diverse questions and research types), and the potential for contributing new perspectives and histories (especially for studying local and non-Western societies, globalisation, and histories of colonisation and encounter).</p> <p>Given the prominent place of political and economic history, it may appear that our work prioritises themes that have traditionally dominated historiography over the last two centuries. However, it is important to note that our focus on seemingly conventional themes is paired with deliberately unconventional efforts: (i) in the case of political history, we aim to highlight lesser-known Asian polities that have received minimal attention in traditional historiography; and (ii) we seek to mitigate the prevailing emphasis on Dutch trade and shipping by also examining the more invasive aspects of European colonialism, as well as the economic, political, and social activities of non-European actors.</p>"},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#from-themes-to-research-practice","title":"From Themes to Research Practice","text":"<p>The GLOBALISE infrastructure enables both simple and sophisticated text searches on the resource corpus.

While the infrastructure can make the archive more accessible, it also influences what is searched and found, which histories are written, and which topics enter public debate. This concern is critical given the archive\u2019s colonial bias. To ensure we remain accountable, we document all our work responsibly and strive to communicate the limitations and implications of our infrastructure clearly to users. Interim publications of curated data, published on our Dataverse, include rich documentation, and the final infrastructure will feature reflective documentation.</p> <p>Similarly, a critical perspective is required when using the project\u2019s curated historical data. This data is shaped by the worldviews, knowledge, and expertise of the project team and contributors. We strive for transparency about our positionality, adhering to up-to-date ethical standards. However, we acknowledge that neutrality is unattainable. Large-scale digitisation and enrichment efforts carry inherent pitfalls, and given the size of the archives, we must rely on machine learning for event and entity annotations, which we can only partially manually check for accuracy. Transparency about methods, findings, and efforts to ensure consistency, historical accuracy, and limit gaps and biases remains our priority.</p> <p>This discussion of the potential drawbacks or shortcomings of our infrastructure is not intended as an excuse, but rather as a reminder and call to action: to engage with the archive responsibly, to design our infrastructure in an open and reflective manner, to check and improve the quality of its content, and to instruct, educate, and challenge users to fully explore its potential (while remaning aware of the limitations), and continuing to develop our source and methodological criticism.</p>"},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#harnessing-big-data-responsibly","title":"Harnessing Big Data Responsibly","text":"<p>As researchers engage with the new possibilities of digital archives, we emphasise the need for critical methods when interpreting digital sources. Researchers should reflect on each document\u2019s type, context, authorship, and purpose. The archives do not provide unfiltered historical truths; they offer fragmented observations and interpretations that require careful contextualisation. Advanced search functions enable researchers to extract snippets of information, but these should be understood as representations of historical realities shaped by the document\u2019s context.</p> <p>While the infrastructure project remains transparent about the processes, tools, and methods used, we cannot anticipate all forms of future usage. We call on users to engage responsibly and contextually, and we will work to provide guidance on how to do so.</p>"},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#research-questions-and-infrastructure-elements","title":"Research Questions and Infrastructure Elements","text":"<p>What questions can be asked of the archive? What queries can be facilitated by more advanced forms of querying and research? In the second part of this document, we explain and illustrate the guiding research questions that our infrastructure supports. These guiding research questions are formulated as generalised queries. For instance, a researcher might ask, \u2018Which polities were in conflict with the VOC between 1640 and 1690?\u2019, or \u2018At which moments was Banten conquered by other polities?\u2019 These are all manifestations of our guiding key research question: \u2018When and which polities (or rulers) were in conflict with other polities?\u2019 These questions inform our infrastructure\u2019s components, such as datasets, thesauri, and the event ontology.</p> <p>For a user to find relevant information about these questions, the GLOBALISE infrastructure needs to provide the following elements:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Reference data Our dataset on early modern polities provides users with chronological information on polities like Banten, including locations, rulers, and periods of rule. If Sultan Agon appears in the archive, users will find contextual information identifying him as Banten\u2019s ruler from 1651 to 1683. We also compile all name and spelling variations (e.g., Banten as Bantam, Banttam, Bantamm), making it easier for users to locate these entities, regardless of spelling differences in their queries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thesaurus For the research questions mentioned here, we classify polities and rulerships into categories allowing users to expand or narrow their searches. </p> </li> <li> <p>Annotations and Ontology We tag all mentions of polities in the archive and our event detection process identifies events that involve actions such as attacking (which includes sub-classes such as starting a war, ending a war, besieging and invasion), destroying and relationship-change. This enables us to plot all such events that are suggestive of troubled interactions which involve actors such as the polities Banten and the VOC, together with other relevant information such as when and where these events occurred. Users will therefore be able to sift through the archive and search for precisely those passages which signal conflict or conquest. </p> </li> </ol> <p>In the following overview of our guiding key research questions we will for each question indicate how these are related to different domains of our historical reference data for entities (and conversions and events), as well as for different sections of the thesauri and event ontology. These guiding questions shape our efforts to design an infrastructure that facilitates targeted historical research, ensuring that the VOC archives are accessible for exploring specific themes and inquiries.</p> <p>Researchers can use this overview to gain a clearer understanding of the types of research the GLOBALISE infrastructure is built to support. Each question aligns with one of the project\u2019s five core domains\u2014Political, Economic, Social, Environmental, and Cultural\u2014that we identified as essential for studying the VOC\u2019s historical impact. For each domain, we provide a list of \u2018research ingredients\u2019\u2014specific data types, document categories, and resources within the infrastructure\u2014that aid in locating relevant information.</p> <p>The accompanying diagram provides an overview of this structure. The five research domains are represented in colored ellipses, each associated with guiding questions. Surrounding these domains are various components of the GLOBALISE infrastructure, displayed in white boxes. Colored diamonds indicate which components are relevant to each domain, illustrating how the infrastructure links diverse data elements to address a broad range of historical research needs.</p> <p> Click image to enlarge</p>"},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#political","title":"Political","text":""},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#scope","title":"Scope","text":"<ol> <li>History of colonial expansion  </li> <li>History of non-European states  </li> <li>History of diplomacy, political (and polity) relations  </li> <li>History of conflict: war, genocide and depopulation  </li> </ol>"},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#research-queries","title":"Research Queries","text":"<ul> <li>When and which polities (or rulers) were in conflict with other polities?   </li> <li>Where and when did polities (or rulers) make agreements with other polities (or rulers)?
