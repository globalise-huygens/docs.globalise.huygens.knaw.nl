Mission Statement","text":"<p>GLOBALISE is an infrastructure project dedicated to enhancing the way we access and understand the archives of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). This infrastructural endeavour aims to unveil interactions between European stakeholders and, more crucially, non-European entities, operating within and around the VOC\u2019s \u2018empire\u2019. By doing so, GLOBALISE will shed new light on the mechanisms of early globalisation, colonialisation, and their formative and enduring impact on regions stretching from Europe, especially the Netherlands, to the vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and Indonesian Archipelago.</p> <p>Our mission can be encapsulated in the following core commitments:</p> <p>1. Enhancing Accessibility At its core, GLOBALISE is committed to making a substantial segment of the VOC archives not just accessible, but contextually relevant to audiences worldwide. Through this project, history enthusiasts, researchers, and the global community will gain an unprecedented level of insight into the VOC\u2019s expansive influence and interactions. This objective will be achieved by transforming the archives into digitised and searchable text using handwritten text recognition. Additionally, GLOBALISE will employ historic and semantic contextualisation to enhance research possibilities and allow for richer representations of history. And finally it will develop versatile interfaces, designed to cater to a diverse range of users. </p> <p>2. Linked Open Data We will model, publish, and host our data as Linked Open Data (LOD), link them to external datasets and thesauri, and thus facilitate easy re-use of our data, aligning with the FAIR principles and global LOD initiatives in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector.</p> <p>3. Tools GLOBALISE will offer a comprehensive suite of open source tools, allowing users to engage with, analyse, and reinterpret historical archives. These tools are designed to support a range of activities, from data creation, annotation, documentation, filtering and visualisation.</p> <p>4. Addressing Power Imbalances and Biases We acknowledge power imbalances and historical injustices recorded in and accompanying the creation of the VOC archives and actively work towards amplifying marginalised perspectives, supplementing the VOC archives with non-European perspectives to challenge dominant narratives and foster a more comprehensive understanding of (colonial) history. </p> <p>5. Transparency We believe in being transparent about the origins and frameworks behind data. We are committed to disclosing our methodologies, acknowledging the limitations of our data, and inviting community feedback to ensure our work is grounded in ethical and responsible practices.</p> <p>6. Free and Open Access Adhering to the FAIR principles, all our resources, software, and data are licensed under open and permissive licences. </p> <p>7. Diversity, Inclusion, Equity, and Decolonisation This commitment extends across all aspects of the project, from the selection of datasets to resource allocation, community engagement, and team composition. </p>"},{"location":"ethics/policy/#iii-ethics-guidelines","title":"III.

They shed light on the many local, regional, and global interactions between these regions (e.g., Kuruppath 2019). Funded to create a research infrastructure for these archives, the GLOBALISE project focuses on the Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren (OBP), which contains copies of reports, letters, and other documents from regions where the VOC was active. We make the OBP\u2019s contents available by identifying entities and events in a full transcription of the archival text, further contextualised with high-quality reference data and documentation. This information is freely accessible in a user-friendly, advanced research environment. With these activities, the GLOBALISE project aims to foster new, diverse, and more representative histories based on VOC archives.</p> <p>The project is conceived as both an infrastructural and archival contribution, with expected impacts on digital humanities and historiography.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Moving Beyond Searchability to Researchability    First, we aim to move the focus of infrastructures for digised archives beyond searchability (e.g., keyword search of transcribed text) to focus on advancing researchability. We achieve this by combining natural language processing and digital humanities technologies with \u2018historical contextualisation\u2019. Here, we create high-quality, curated, and validated historical knowledge that is incorporated into domain-specific reference data and thesauri (for example, for polities, persons, commodities, and ships). This combination ensures that automatic methods for recognising and identifying events and entities in the digitised archival material produce observations relevant to historical research. Our aim is not merely to enable researchers and the broader public to perform free text searches on a vast, rich archival corpus; instead, we go beyond free-text searches to provide contextualisation, enabling new ways of conducting historical research.</p> </li> <li> <p>Innovative, Inclusive Techniques    Our mission lies in finding responsible and useful methods to combine historical and semantic contextualisation while simultaneously encouraging the \u2018democratisation\u2019 of research, data, and knowledge. We strive to keep technical barriers low for potential users, making our infrastructure accessible to academic and societal audiences worldwide. The acronym of our project, derived from its technical approach (the General Letters Ontology-Based Accessibility InfraStructurE<sup>1</sup>), also emphasises that globalisation has historically been unequal. The forces of colonialism and capitalism continuously produced connectedness alongside dispossession and exploitation. This applies to both \u2018early globalisation\u2019 which accelerated with European colonial expansion, and \u2018high globalisation\u2019, which began in the 1980s and continues in the digital era. The project name reminds us of these historical and contemporary inequalities, and we seek to move away from the exploitative aspects of globalisation by building and publishing our work in an open, reusable, and inclusive way. To this end, we actively reach out to scholars worldwide to incorporate multiple perspectives and scrutinise colonial biases that led to uneven knowledge production and its availability in digital form.</p> </li> <li> <p>Historiographic Intervention    The longstanding disregard of the VOC\u2019s colonial, expansionist, and violent character has led to a limited, persistently Eurocentric perspective in VOC historiography. While area studies, non-Western, and world history have used VOC archives to explore histories of local societies, polities, people, and their resilience, the dominant narrative still portrays the VOC as a \u2018merchant\u2019 focused on trade and shipping. This ignores the broader historical reality: the VOC\u2019s colonial empire-building, its organisation of international political order (war and diplomacy), its administration of territorial possessions (rule and governance), and its regulation of commodity production (agriculture, mining, etc.). This revised perspective reframes the VOC as a colonial force acting as \u2018military\u2019, \u2018government\u2019, and \u2018producer\u2019. It also raises questions about the VOC\u2019s impact on local people and societies and how these interactions shaped local, regional, and global histories (Van Rossum 2019).</p> </li> </ol> <p>This historiographic shift emphasises using VOC archives to study (a) local, global, and colonial political, economic, cultural, social, and everyday interactions in the early modern world and (b) the transformations many societies experienced as a result of these interactions. These questions on European colonial expansion and globalisation\u2019s effects on local societies are crucial to academic and societal debates on the legacies of colonialism, capitalism, slavery, and racialisation. By utilising the VOC archives, the project aims to \u2018unseat\u2019 the VOC as the principal object of study, instead highlighting the politics and societies in the Indian Ocean World as historical subjects in their own right. To support this objective, the project is actively developing, collecting, and curating more data on non-European entities, such as persons, polities, commodities, ships, and communities.</p>"},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#research-themes-guiding-the-infrastructure","title":"Research Themes Guiding the Infrastructure","text":"<p>Rigorous historical and technical work is required to handle the abundance and heterogeneity of primary source material in the archives. Central to this effort is understanding the historical contexts and relationships between entities. This contextualisation requires a focused, domain-specific approach, but it is clear that GLOBALISE should not be limited to a single thematic research area. Instead, it should cover a well-considered selection of domains to serve a wide range of audiences and research interests.</p> <p>Shaping our vision based on the three interventions described above, we have formulated the following guiding questions:</p> <ul> <li>Why and how did interactions between (European) colonial actors and (non-European) local societies develop according to specific historical patterns?</li> <li>How did expanding European influence impact political, societal, economic, environmental, and cultural developments in the wider Indian Ocean, Indonesian Archipelago, and East Asian Seas regions?</li> <li>How can the VOC archives be used to their fullest potential in writing histories of local, non-Western societies?</li> </ul> <p>To answer these questions, we have identified a series of themes and sub-themes that can stimulate a wide range of research into the social, political, economic, and cultural history of European expansion, non-Western societies, early globalisation, and related interactions. The key thematic domains we have defined are:</p> <ul> <li>Political</li> <li>Economic</li> <li>Social</li> <li>Cultural</li> <li>Environmental</li> <li>Other</li> </ul> <p>These themes will guide the development of a research infrastructure allowing extraction of useful historical observations from the Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren. While we recognise that any selection is inherently subjective, we have based our choices on several factors: the content of the source material (what appears most frequently), the relevance of themes for the widest range of research interests (which domains and information are most essential for diverse questions and research types), and the potential for contributing new perspectives and histories (especially for studying local and non-Western societies, globalisation, and histories of colonisation and encounter).</p> <p>Given the prominent place of political and economic history, it may appear that our work prioritises themes that have traditionally dominated historiography over the last two centuries. However, it is important to note that our focus on seemingly conventional themes is paired with deliberately unconventional efforts: (i) in the case of political history, we aim to highlight lesser-known Asian polities that have received minimal attention in traditional historiography; and (ii) we seek to mitigate the prevailing emphasis on Dutch trade and shipping by also examining the more invasive aspects of European colonialism, as well as the economic, political, and social activities of non-European actors.</p>"},{"location":"mission/mission_researchthemes/#from-themes-to-research-practice","title":"From Themes to Research Practice","text":"<p>The GLOBALISE infrastructure enables both simple and sophisticated text searches on the resource corpus.

This concern is critical given the archive\u2019s colonial bias. To ensure we remain accountable, we document all our work responsibly and strive to communicate the limitations and implications of our infrastructure clearly to users. Interim publications of curated data, published on our Dataverse, include rich documentation, and the final infrastructure will feature reflective documentation.</p> <p>Similarly, a critical perspective is required when using the project\u2019s curated historical data.

This enables us to plot all such events that are suggestive of troubled interactions which involve actors such as the polities Banten and the VOC, together with other relevant information such as when and where these events occurred.
